    <h1>Welcome to our Monthly Jam!</h1>
    <p>This is the monthly game jam. If you already know what a Game Jam is and the rules, then you can jump <a href='#theme'>here</a>.</p>
    <h2>How do I rate the games</h2>
    <p>I rate the games by three qualities:</p>
    <ul style='font-size: 20px;'>
      <li>Quality</li>
      <li>Creativity</li>
      <li>If it follows the rules</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I give each of the qulities a scale from 0 to 10. And the add those scales to get a score. The tiers:</p>
    <ul style='font-size: 20px;'>
      <li>A score from 27 to 30 mans your game is featured. When you get this, you will be reconized in the "Games" section of this website.</li>
      <li>A score from 24 to 26 means your game is good, but not the best I played.</li>
      <li>A score from 21 to 25 means your game is average.</li>
      <li>A score from 20 to 18 means you have a lot to improve in your game</li>
      <li>A score 17 or below means that your game fails</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Rules</h2>
    <ul style='font-size: 20px;'>
      <li>Games can't include any inappropiate stuff, such as gore, threats, or personal information.</li>
      <li>Games can't be larger than 20KB</li>
      <li>Games can't be generated by AI (Artificial Intelligence)</li>
      <li>Games should stick to the corrisponding theme. (If that rule didn't exist, then the monthly game jams would be no fun.)</li>
      <li>Your game has to be original.</li>
      <li>If I have to download your game, your game should be found in an .sb3 or a .html extension.</li>
    </ul>
